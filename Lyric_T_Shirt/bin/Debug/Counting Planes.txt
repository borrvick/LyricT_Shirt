I see our eyes up
In the stars they
Are far lost like us
Do you think of space and
It’s creation
Whose creation is us?
We can’t decide who we love
I know we have been here before
I swear no one can take it from us
One day we can start again
One love confused and divided because
Our fear tend to be greater than us
On day we could love again
Let’s lie on our backs and
We will gaze up
And rephrase what we know
It’s alright to say that you don’t know things
You don’t know things I know
We can’t decide who we love
I know we have been here before
I swear no one can take it from us
One day we can start again
One love confused and divided because
Our fear tend to be greater than us
On day we could love again
We want it, we need it, we wanna be alright
I know we have been here before
I swear no one can take it from us
One day we can start again
One love confused and divided because
Our fear tend to be greater than us
On day we could love again
