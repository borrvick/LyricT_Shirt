I’m separated 
It’s how my mind goes
Like an edge of a wall to my elbow
Step away outside
From myself and I
Lacking sense of what’s a lie
Carefully, carefully
What will you do?
Is it high?
Is it low?
Is it something in between or in a hole?
I’m complicated
It’s kinda old school
Looking at your world through an eye hole
It’s hard to say
Because I don’t know why
Carefully, carefully
What am I to do?
Is it high?
Is it low?
Is it something in between or in a hole?
Is it faith
That keeps us clean?
Or is it human nature to do our good deeds?
Is it high
After all
Things were made to change
I’m at the corner of
Conflicted and afraid
Can I believe at all
This world was made to die
Could you believe to be?
