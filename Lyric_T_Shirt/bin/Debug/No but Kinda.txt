Fall back again
I Retain  the words you said
“Just like as if kids
Some are and aren’t, pre-planned
All these games
Are getting pretty dim
The waters getting stahle
And I forget to swim
Look at me
Like I’m all you’ve ever seen
And I’ll Return a love
That I’ve only seen in dreams
I cock back and sit
To wait and find you hear
Or loved inside a mirror
I cock back and drift
Into a stateless bit
I’ve grown through the change
Does it stand to last
If change never stays
Does that mean I won’t go back
All these days
Are getting pretty binned
I woke up yesterday
And I only breathed in sin
Look at me like and addict with a gun
Always turning heads
But only get helped when I’m done
I cock back and sit
To wait and find you hear
Or loved inside a mirror
I cock back and drift
Into a stateless bit
Just know that I care
And know that I’m scared
Will I act on my fears?
Is there even some thing there
Just know that I care
And know that I’m scared
Will I act on my fears?
Was there ever some thing there?
I cock back and sit
To wait and find you hear
Or loved inside a mirror
I cock back and drift
Into a stateless bit
