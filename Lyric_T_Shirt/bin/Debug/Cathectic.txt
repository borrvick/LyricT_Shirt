Am I the sharp side of everything I hate
A handle that’s sharper than it’s own dull blade
I’ve been sitting down too much
I think I’m thinking way too much
Oh god, I wish that I was never born
What would I find?
What would I need?
If the world stood at my feet
Would I be a liar?
We’ll wait and find out
And I’m sure that somehow
We will all be known
I’ve never been one to wear name brands on my shirt
I copy and paste things and then complain im hurt

We’ll wait and find out
