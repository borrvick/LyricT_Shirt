Speak to me
I wanted you to speak to me
Cause everything is not the same I’m lonely
Every pain is temporary
You will find aversion to my name
Speak to me
Cause everything is not the same
I want it back to you
Tell me things
Oh tell me all the things you’ve seen
Even the ones you say you’re not to tell me
Maybe in the end they’ll help me
Everyday I wake up feeling just the same
Maybe one day I’ll finally learn to learn from
My own damn mistakes
To come back and build a home
A peasant love is all I’ve known
I’m worried that I’ll only ever
Feel this way
Speak to me
Cause everything is not the same
I want it back to you
People talk and they’ll find different ways
Maybe I’m wrong
Maybe I’m wrong
Speak to me
Cause everything is not the same
I want it back to you
Speak to me
I wanted you to speak to me
Cause everything is not the same I’m lonely
Every pain is temporary
You will find aversion to my name
