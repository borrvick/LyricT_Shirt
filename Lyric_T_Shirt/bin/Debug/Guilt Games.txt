Honestly I’m scared
I just run from everything
I’m a piece of
I’m a selfish selfless being
Well ain’t it the truth
That I’ll lead you on
We’re sat playing games
And I’ve jumped you pawn
Well I don’t like how
I’m a human now
And the world has got
All the best of me I swear
This is everything to me
Now we’re playing cards
Well I’ve never been a good liar
My mouth will start to twitch
Oh I’ve slipped up, can you forget this tomorrow?
Well how can I be
Such a human now
My heart wants to love
But my brains in hell
Well I once was clean
Now my brain has seen
Am I one like you?
Are you one like me?
I swear
This is everything to me
