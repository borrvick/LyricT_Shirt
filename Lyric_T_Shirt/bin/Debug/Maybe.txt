Sit in a room
I’ll tell me how I think of you
Or how I think of me
This is where it begins
Stood on a ledge
Jump then take three deep breathes in
I land right on a couch this is where it begins
Talking away yeah
Say I’m looking to make change
But I slept my day away
Maybe Tomorrow
Hey Maybe
Maybe I am not the man you see
Maybe it’s just tricks and smoke you love
Maybe not me
Slip in my faith
my heads bigger than my brain
It’s just sick and tired of fighting in my headspace
King to call
Till my voice is raw
A part of me apostrophes
Oh yeah
Hey Maybe
Maybe I am not the man you see
Maybe it’s just tricks and smoke you love
Maybe not me
Hey Maybe
Maybe it’s just how I love it’s me
Concerned of what people think and see
And finding me fake
I don’t want you
But I need you
It controls me
To control you
And maybe if we talked this out
I’d leave my head and all its doubts It controls me
To control you
And maybe if we talked this out
I’d leave my head and all its doubts
