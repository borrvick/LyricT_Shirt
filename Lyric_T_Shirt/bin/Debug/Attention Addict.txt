Sometimes when I wake up
I’m still sleeping in my head
Dreaming kinda feels good
Just not an hour from your bed
Why do I feel like I’m so sad
I know my life’s not even bad
I guess I’m being
Overdramatic
Maybe I’m an attention addict
I know when I messed up
I tend to take things way too far
Do my friends even like me?
I’m convenient when they’re not
And I can’t remember names
Cause I’m busy saying things
Awkward silence always choke me up
Why do I feel like I’m so sad
I know my life’s not even bad
I guess I’m being
Overdramatic
Maybe I’m an attention addict
I know I’m messed up
I know it’s messed up
I know we’re messed up
I know it’s messed up
