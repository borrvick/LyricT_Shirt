And this is how
A man creates himself
He builds a wall
And then she knocks it down
Across the board
This game it don’t seem bad
But then you find out I am nothing but a heart attack
I understand where you’re coming from baby
But I just feel like I’ve been lying to me lately
It’s not your fault it’s just things are in my head
In my head, in my head in my head
I’m not a trend
And this is overkill
Let’s not pretend
That there is more to this
And this is how
A man is seen right through
He hides his heart
And makes it hard to lose
Across the board
There’s things that should be said
But he’s afraid if he speaks he’ll have nothing left
I understand where you’re coming from baby
But I just feel like I’ve been lying to me lately
It’s not your fault it’s just things are in my head
In my head, in my head in my head
I’m not a trend
And this is overkill
Let’s not pretend
That there is more to this
I’m not a trend
And this is overkill
I’m not a trend
And this is overkill
Let’s not pretend
That there is more to this
I’m not a trend
And this is overkill
Let’s not pretend
That there is more to this
