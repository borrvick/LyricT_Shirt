Thirteen
You freak
You’d slap the if you’d speak
A palm
That’s red and not your own
Keep me closer
I’ll follow
I’ll always
I’m dependant
To get by
I’m always
I need you
My blank check
Sugar Pills and
Training wheels and
I cash you
Just to get by
Everyday
Everyday
You live
You breathe
Through a glass lit LCD
Your joy
Is made by you alone
They’ll keep you closer
They’ll follow
They’ll always
They’re dependant
To get by
They won’t say
I need you
My blank check
Sugar Pills and
Training wheels and
I cash you
Just to stand up
Everyday
Everyday
I need you
My blank check
Sugar Pills and
Training wheels and
I cash you
Just to get by everyday
Everyday
Everyday
You’re my pill
I’ll swallow
Baby come here
I’m so hollow
I need to just to stand up
Everyday
Everyday
