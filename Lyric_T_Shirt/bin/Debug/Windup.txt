Call in the naval boats
This army's men is dying
dying
We walk with our toy guns
Flashing around we’re lying
lying
Are we on one last dance?
Oh we’ve waited for so long
Fighting with my one man band
Let this music take us home
We’re falling on the ground
Our feet land on the clouds
My heart flows day and light
My heads a stormy night
I’m crying
Crying
This blood is draining rays
It’s clotting sloth and vain
I’m trying
Trying
Are we on one last dance?
Oh we’ve waited for so long
Fighting with my one man band
Let this music take us home
We’re falling
We’re gonna take it from you
Are we on one last dance?
Oh we’ve waited for so long
Fighting with my one man band
Let this music take us home
We’re falling on the ground
Our feet land on the clouds
I say I’m tired
You say I’m good
Let’s have this dance
You step on my shoes
I say I’m tired
You say I’m good
Let’s start a war
You say I’m a fool
